# TUD_Dragonflies_and_Drones
Repository for MSc. thesis research in Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft MAVLab titled *'**Hunt like a dragonfly, strike like a drone**: learning pursuit controllers for insect interception through multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for onboard use in autonomous quadcopters'*. 



### Visualizations
This repository contains interactive visualizations of 3D trajectories collected from confrontations between our optimized pursuer and evader agents as well as between the optimized pursuer agents and the offline Opogona recordings (provided by SOURCE). Trajectories are created using Plotly, saved in HTML files and stored in the visualizations folder of this repository. 

Within these files, the pursuer and evader trajectories are blue and red respectively, with a similarly colored sphere indicating their initial position. Orange and green spheres on top of a trajectory highlight that the agent in question is in the motion-camouflage game state. The grey connecting lines define the lines-of-sight between the agents at a periodic interval. The green neon line indicates the shortest distance between agents observed within a trial.
